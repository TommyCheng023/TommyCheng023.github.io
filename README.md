# Brief Walkthrough (Web Users)
- This is an interactive and mobile responsive personal website. 
- **NEW FEATURE!!** The webpage will be displayed in a custom dark mode from 19:00 to 6:00, at Eastern Daylight Time Zone.

Except for [BUCSSA](https://www.bucssa.org/), all mentioned industries or organizations are linked to their official websites.
## Left Menu
A menu holding a sticky position displaying my `current location`(click on it will change into my `home location`) as well as a list of contacts, including `email address`, `LinkedIn`, `GitHub`, `Instagram`, `Discord` and `WeChat`(which is actually `WeCom` for privacy reasons).

## Right Division
The main content is divided into four sections: `About`, `Projects`, `Teaching` and `Advising`.

- `About`: It starts with an introduction in the third-person, followed by a button where you can download my resume as `PDF` if you click on it. My resume will be updated once a month.
  - After that, you can see a subsection called **tech stack** displaying all used **programming languages, scripts and frameworks** through out my path of R&D with their logos showed as badges.
- `Projects`: This sections contain all landing projects I've done since 2021. Most of the projects contain a link to the source code or the deployed product. I'm trying to make the rest visible as soon as possible.
  - For projects with a report or an essay as the final output, those files are locked with passwords. If you're a recruiter or someone interested in the content, I'm willing to provide the password!
  - There's no detailed introduction displayed, only `contributor(s)`, as well as optional information: `framework&language`, `organization`, `company`.
- `Teaching`: This section contains all experiences I had in the past at specific education industries.
- `Advising`: This section displays students I've advised, mainly on high school and university applications. If possible, their offers may be updated in the website!
- `MapMyVisitors`: I added an external source from [MapMyVisitors](https://mapmyvisitors.com/) to check my web visitors, which will be displayed at the bottom of the page. 
## Navbar
**You can go to each section without scrolling yourself by clicking on the contents of the navbar.**

## WeCom Page
When clicking on `WeChat`, you'll enter another page displaying the QR Code of my `WeCom`. Due to the privacy reason of my personal accounts as well as the privacy policy of `WeChat`, I cannot display my account through a link.

You can return to the main page by clicking on `Xinyang Cheng` in the navbar

# Brief Walkthrough (Mobile Users)
- **NEW FEATURE!!** The webpage will be displayed in a custom dark mode from 19:00 to 6:00, at Eastern Daylight Time Zone.

# Future Expectations

## New Sections
- `Publications`: wait until my first essay is published üòÇ
- `Research`: for the purpose of recording R&D experiences, this section is necessary to be independent from `Projects`

## Feature Updates

- Change the `day/night` mode into a client-controllable feature. Remove the auto-change feature based on EST time zone.
