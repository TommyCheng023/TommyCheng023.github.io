## Xinyang(Tommy) Cheng's personal website.
Feel free to check out my personal website! :D

link: https://xinyang-cheng.com/

# Brief Walkthrough (Web Users)
This is an interactive and mobile responsive personal website. 

Except for [BUCSSA](https://www.bucssa.org/), all mentioned industries or organizations are linked to their official websites.
## Left Menu
A menu holding a sticky position displaying my `current location`(click on it will change into my `home location`) as well as a list of contacts, including `email address`, `LinkedIn`, `GitHub`, `Instagram`, `Discord` and `WeChat`(which is actually `WeCom` for privacy reasons).

## Right Division
The main content is divided into four sections: `About`, `Projects`, `Teaching` and `Advising`.

- `About`: It starts with an introduction in the third-person, followed by displaying all used **programming languages, scripts and frameworks** through out my path of R&D.
- `Projects`: This sections contain all landing projects I've done since 2021. Most of the projects contain a link to the source code or the deployed product. I'm trying to make the rest visible as soon as possible.
  - For projects with a report or an essay as the final output, those files are locked with passwords. If you're a recruiter or someone interested in the content, I'm willing to provide the password!
  - There's no detailed introduction displayed, only `contributor(s)`, as well as optional information: `framework&language`, `organization`, `company`.
- `Teaching`: This section contains all experiences I had in the past at specific education industries.
- `Advising`: This section displays students I've advised, mainly on high school and university applications. If possible, their offers may be updated in the website!

## Navbar
**You can go to each section without scrolling yourself by clicking on the contents of the navbar.**

## WeCom Page
When clicking on `WeChat`, you'll enter another page displaying the QR Code of my `WeCom`. Due to the privacy reason of my personal accounts as well as the privacy policy of `WeChat`, I cannot display my account through a link.

You can return to the main page by clicking on `Xinyang Cheng` in the navbar

# Brief Walkthrough (Mobile Users)
## Navbar
- My contacts are moved to the navbar with icons displayed only. Clicking on the icons will send you to my profiles.
- WeCom page is inaccessible in mobile template.


## Left Menu
This division is removed in mobile template.

## Right Division
It is now the main section of the webpage.

# Future Expectations
## apply framework
- I'm considering using `Angular` or `React` to my personal website.
## New Features
- add `day/night` reading mode
## New Sections
- `Publications`: wait until my first essay is published üòÇ
- `Research`: for the purpose of recording R&D experiences, this section is necessary to be independent from `Projects`
